Presentation of the Detail View Layout Widget.

===

For some time now coreBOS has had the [Detail View Layout Mapping](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:detailviewlayout&noprocess=1) but it was not used inside the application anywhere. It was used to define field and module layouts in external applications.

We started creating the editor for this business map type. This task took us to refine the map directives/structure and implement a developer widget that uses it to show the different types supported inside coreBOS (this way we could test the structure too).

The [documentation page in the wiki](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:detailviewlayout&noprocess=1#detail_view_layout_widget) has been updated with the new structure definitions and also with a section on the new detail view widget, which also contains a link to the video presentation I leave below.
