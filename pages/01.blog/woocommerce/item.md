Presenting the WordPress-WooCommerce and coreBOS Integration

===

<span style="font-size:large">Time for another integration project!</span>

Truth is that we don't stop adding integrations with all sorts of other applications. If you add on top of that, tools like the [Run Web Service Workflow Task](../runwswftask) or [Integromat](../august2018) and all the boilerplate and infrastructure coreBOS gives us to implement these integrations, we can be proud of the enormous possibilities this application has.

This integration supports a two-way synchronization of products and customers between the two applications and a one-way synchronization of orders from the WordPress website to your coreBOS. So we will be able to automatically receive all our website orders inside coreBOS where we can manage them in our business logic while triggering all our workflows and business processes.

I am going to leave here a small video presentation and the [link to the documentation page](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:integrations:woocommerce&noprocess=1).
