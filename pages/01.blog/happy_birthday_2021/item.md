Almost **[One score and seven years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address)** we brought forth upon this world, a new application, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all companies should be able to manage their business easily but with power and adaptability. We started this project named **coreBOS**. Would I do it again? Definitely! What is the best part? Seeing how much we have achieved, and all the things that are still to come!

## coreBOS is seven years old!

I had a quick look at this past year's posts and commits, once again it is astonishing:

- Workflows: non-stop enhancements
- Webservice: non-stop enhancements
- Decision Maps
- Map Editors
- Business Questions enhancements (Builder)
- Denormalization Project
- Export and Import Relations, Menu, and Workflows
- ModTracker enhancements
- LDS
- listviewRow Business Actions
- Notification panel
- Integrations galore
  - ElasticSearch Integration
  - OneSignal
  - WebDav
  - InBucket
  - Woocommerce
  - Redis/Memcached
- coreBOS Universal Unique Record Identifier (UUID)
- Unit tests, even for web service externally

Just to name a few that caught my attention.

Similar to the previous year I kept working on the blog post series talking about existing and/or new functionality in coreBOS while maintaining the regular monthly blog post about the changes going on each month.

My plan for this next year is to continue with the same format. I think it is useful to show the features and how we use them and the constant flow of changes makes it easy to see that the project is very much alive and active. Besides the effort to create those two blog posts is just about as much as I can fit into my agenda.

So, in the months ahead I am going to release two regular posts a month. One, on the first week of the month, which will be a series covering usage, functionality, and configuration topics. The other will be on the third week of the month and will continue the same process I have been using to explain the most important things that happened to the coreBOS application the previous month, so we will keep getting a constant flow of things that are happening.

As usual, I have a list of things to talk about but I am open to suggestions, so if there is anything you would like to read about, don't hesitate to reach out to me and I will try to organize.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for being part of the **coreBOS project**. I wish you a wonderful year.

 !!! **<span style="font-size:large">Happy Birthday from/to the whole coreBOS Team</span>**
