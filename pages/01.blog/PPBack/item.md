Getting back to the community and blog.

===

Hello!  It has been a while :-)

For the last four months, I have been extremely busy. So much so that I have been forced to stop attending this blog and the community as I would like. Things seem to be getting calmer and I intend to get back to a normal pace here sharing all the things that are happening in the coreBOS world.

Obviously, for those of you that have been watching the repository, coreBOS has not stopped a moment so I have a lot of catching up to do.

My current plan is to update the "changelog" series with the changes of the last months and start posting about some of the new features that have landed in that time in order to keep the average number of posts stable at the end of the year.

For now. I leave you with the latest documentation effort I have been working on; [the web service manual](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:devel:corebosws&noprocess=1), [this anecdote of Luis de Le√≥n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_Le%C3%B3n#Imprisonment) and an "As we were saying yesterday...." after a much more comfortable work imprisonment.
