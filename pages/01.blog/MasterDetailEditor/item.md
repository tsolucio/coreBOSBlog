Learn how to configure and use a generic master-detail editor in coreBOS.

===

coreBOS has had a [Master-Detail Business Map](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?noprocess=1&id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:masterdetailmapping) for some time now, but it had very limited support inside the application. It was only supported in the existing [master-detail inventory modules](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?noprocess=1&id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:masterdetailmapping#master_detail_on_inventory_modules). We are actively using this business map for custom developments. The time has come to have native support for it.

As of last month, coreBOS has an opinionated way of supporting a [generic master-detail editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93detail_interface).

Building upon the [Developer Blocks functionality](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?noprocess=1&id=en:devel:add_special_block&#developer_blocks) and the [Toast UI Grid](https://ui.toast.com/tui-grid), which is becoming an integral part of coreBOS, we have added the possibility for anyone to set up a master-detail editor between two modules with a one-to-many relation.

You can [read about the configuration here.](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?noprocess=1&id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:masterdetailmapping) and watch the video presentation:

As usual, we are available for support and fixes, so reach out as needed.
