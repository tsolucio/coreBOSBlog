Those of you who know me better understand that I do not believe in new years resolutions and have probably heard me say something like

> life is not going to wait for a specific day to surprise you, so you don't have to wait for any specific day to change your life either.

That said, I do recognize the social status of the first of January in our current culture and our ever more globalized world, so I will take the opportunity that I am writing this blog post on this day to digress a little from our typical subjects.

I would like to send a sincere **thank you** to all the people who have made coreBOS a reality. Those who have supported this crazy idea from the start and are still here, those who have touched our journey and have left for other opportunities in their lives, those who have come recently and keep it full of energy and **alive**, those who use coreBOS to make their lives easier, those who use it to make other peoples lives easier, and even those that are just looking in disbelief ...

!!!! I wish you a year full of happiness, love, and good fortune.

My personal plan, as project manager of this awesomazing software, is to keep the ball rolling and the application growing. There are a lot of really interesting ideas being discussed (and even developed), like a dashboard view per module, a good queue management infrastructure, enhance kanban, marketing dashboard, analytics, clickhouse, and a lot of areas that require attention. I expect another year full of incredible things.

**I look forward to sharing the journey with you.**

A big hug (we need a lot of these).

Take care of yourselves!

Joe
