# Business Cases

A module that gives you a complete overview and control of your business. Using the Business Case module, you can easily divide and group your business tasks into several cohesive and related sets of records.

The Business Case module captures all entity modules and their records in one place. In addition, you can define for each Case its status, priority, description, and other important information.

The main Business Case module benefits are:

- better overview, search and control
- supported for all modules
- easily add, edit or delete the related module records in one place

## Who needs the Business Case module?
