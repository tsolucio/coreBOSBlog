Making Decisions in coreBOS just got a lot easier. We already had [Condition Expression](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:condition_expression&noprocess=1) and [Condition Query](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:condition_query&noprocess=1) **Business Maps** which were put together in [coreBOS Rules](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:devel:corebos_rules&noprocess=1) to give developers a very powerful condition evaluation engine, and, now, we have added upon this another business map to make it even more flexible: [Decision Table Business Maps](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:decisiontable&noprocess=1).

Continue reading to learn how to use this new functionality.

===

Evaluating some conditions and returning a result is an extremely common task in computer science, almost everything we do can be reduced to it. Due to this, **coreBOS as a framework** had to give it's developers and implementors a way to make these decisions at some high-level/abstract way that frees developers from having to modify the code to make those decisions each time the final user has some business logic change (which is also extremely common).

**Enter Decision Table Business Maps**

The concept of a **Decision Table** is very well defined and all the logic and process behind it also. There is a full [Decision Model and Notation Specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN) which defines all the cases and how the problem should be approached and it is all framed in the [BPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management) environment. coreBOS implements it's own Decision Table logic based on the standard specification but very adapted to the specific coreBOS environment and infrastructure. 

The [coreBOS Decision Table Business Map documentation page](https://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:adminmanual:businessmappings:decisiontable&noprocess=1) explains very well the different options and gives a fundamental explanation of how decision making can be done so I decided to record a video showing and explaining the functionality with some live examples.

Hopefully, I have been able to convey the potential this new business map has and I trust it will optimize your customizations.
